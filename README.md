#Factorizorizing Polynomials over Finite Fields

##Project Description:

The aim of this project is to study algorithms for factorization of polynomials  
over finite fields. Such factorizations are interesting in applications of  
finite fields, e.g. coding theory and cryptography, as well as being the key  
ingredient in factorizations over other coefficients.  

In particular two algorithms will be studied:  

1. Berlekamp's algorithm. This is a deterministic algorithm constructed by  
Elwyn Berlekamp in 1967. Until the Cantor-Zassenhaus algorithm (see below)  
appeared, this was the main algorithm used.  

2. The Cantor-Zassenhaus algorithm. This is an algorithm with a lower  
computational complexity that was introduced in 1981. In contrast to  
Berlekamp's algorithm, it is a probabilistic algorithm.
